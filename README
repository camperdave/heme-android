heme - console hex editor

heme is intended to be fast and portable console hex editor for unix systems.
It has undo support (number of undo operations is only limited by available
memory), ability to fill a range of addresses with the specified byte, ability 
to search for a single byte or character string. Offsets can be given in
hexadecimal, octal or decimal. There are two editing modes: hex and ascii. In
hex mode you type hexadecimal digits and in ascii mode you type characters. In 
the ascii mode cursor is automatically moved to the next byte after typing a 
character (this behaviour is configurable for hex mode). heme uses curses library
for screen and input handling. Colors are supported and they may be configured
in the configuration file (see below). If the configuration file isn't present,
heme will use defaults. You may also specify which configuration file to use
with the '-c' command line option. Type 'heme --help' to see list of all command
line options.
